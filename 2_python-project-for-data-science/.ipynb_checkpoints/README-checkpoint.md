# Project Overview
For this project, I have assumed the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. My job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data it will be visualized in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

Objectives:
1. Extract historical stock data using `yfinance` library
1. Extract historical stock data from a web-page using web scraping
1. Analyze historical stock data/revenue data
